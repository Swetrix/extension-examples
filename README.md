> Swetrix Marketplace is deprecated as of 14 December 2025. I decided to focus on building and improving our core features for now. Please let us know on [Discord](https://swetrix.com/discord) if you're interested in using Swetrix Markerplace and custom extensions.

# Swetrix Extension examples
Swetrix allows you to create your own extensions to extend the functionality of the platform.\
These extensions work similarly to browser extensions and allow you to access and process analytics data, display customised pages and much more.

You can also publish your extensions in the [Swetrix Marketplace](https://marketplace.swetrix.com) for others to use.


## Learn more
To learn more about developing Swetrix Extensions, see the [documentation on Marketplace](https://marketplace.swetrix.com/docs) for getting started guides, tutorials, and full API reference docs.
