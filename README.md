# Swetrix Extension examples
Swetrix allows you to create your own extensions to extend the functionality of the platform.\
These extensions work similarly to browser extensions and allow you to access and process analytics data, display customised pages and much more.

You can also publish your extensions in the [Swetrix Marketplace](https://marketplace.swetrix.com) for others to use.
